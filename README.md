# Past Projects 

Here are three past projects to showcase my understanding with machine learning and data processing. 

1. White Wine Quality Prediction Model 

A model is created to predict white wine quality. Following an extensive EDA, a wide range of models were implemented and model interpretability was explored. The white wine dataset was retrieved from [UCL Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). 

2. Adaptive Thermal Comfort Model (Course Project)

Have you ever had an office thermosat fight where you are freezing while your co-worker still complains it's too warm? We have different thermal sensation based on different biologicial and external traits. An adaptive temperature model to predict the optimum room temperature for occupants based on real-time occupant and environment information with logistic regression in Python. [Global Thermal Comfort Database II](http://www.comfortdatabase.com) prodvided by ASHRAE is used. 

3. Day-ahead Hourly Natural Gas Consumption Prediction Model (Course Project)

A model is created to predict day-ahead hourly natural gas consumption for potential natural gas demand response program in Austin, Texas using linear regression and simple neural networks in Python. [Pecan Street dataset] (https://www.pecanstreet.org/dataport/) is used.
